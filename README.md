Hello! My name is Eugene, and I've been hard at work at this coding challenge.  

Here are the files and what they do. I hope you enjoyed my solution:  
PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md: The question I received  
coding_challenge_data_set.txt: The data set I received
coding_challenge.py: The actual code file  
Code-Review.ipynb: The same code in iPython Notebook form  
Coding_Notes_and_Runtime_Analysis.md: The file that explains more in detail about optimizations and tradeoffs that code makes  
unit_test.py: I created 6 test cases to test whether my code is robust against edge cases.  
test_cases: a folder with 6 different test data I made up

I hope you enjoyed looking through my code. I look forward to meeting you in person!
