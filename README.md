Hello! My name is Eugene, and I've been hard at work at this coding challenge.  

Here are the files and what they do. I hope you enjoyed my solution:  
__PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md__: The question I received  
__coding_challenge_data_set.txt__: The data set I received
__coding_challenge.py__: The actual code file  
__Code-Review.ipynb__: The same code in iPython Notebook form  
__Coding_Notes_and_Runtime_Analysis.md__: The file that explains more in detail about optimizations and tradeoffs that code makes  
__unit_test.py__: I created 6 test cases to test whether my code is robust against edge cases.  
__test_cases__: a folder with 6 different test data I made up

I hope you enjoyed looking through my code. I look forward to meeting you in person!
